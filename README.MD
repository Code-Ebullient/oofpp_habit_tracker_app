## Introduction

The Habit Tracker App is a streamlined, user-centric application designed to help individuals build, manage, and maintain positive habits in their daily, weekly, and monthly routines. It provides a personalized interface for users to record, track, and complete habits while visualizing their progress and maintaining consistency through streak tracking. 


## Motivation
The project was inspired by the idea that habits are the foundation of personal growth, but most users struggle to stay consistent. By creating a tool that is both personalized and visually appealing, the app helps users stay on track with their goals. It was created for the *Object-Oriented and Functional Programming with Python*  Portfolio Course at the IU International University of Applied Sciences.


## Goals

1. Empower users to build healthy habits with personalized tracking.

2. Provide an intuitive, minimalist interface that simplifies habit management.

3. Encourage consistency through streak tracking and visual progress.

4. Ensure user data privacy with user-specific habit views.
